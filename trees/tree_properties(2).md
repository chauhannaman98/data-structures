1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘L’ of a binary tree is 2^L-1
   if level starts from 0 then,
   max nodes = 2^L
   
2) Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1.

3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ⌈ Log2(N+1) ⌉

4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ⌈ Log2L ⌉ + 1   levels

5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
